        <div class="col span-1-of-5 a"><h2 class="colo1"><u>HULK</u></h2>Robert Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D. is a renowned scientist who was highly respected for all his work in the fields of Biochemistry, Nuclear Physics, and Gamma Radiation. As part of a program commissioned by General Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum which created Captain America, Banner conducted an experiment with Gamma Radiation. However, when an exposure to high levels of Gamma Radiation instead of Vita Radiation went awry, the mild-mannered scientist had found that when angered or provoked, he would transform into the huge, rage-fueled, nearly mindless and green-skinned monster known as Hulk.</div>
        <div class="col span-1-of-5"><div class="a"><h2 class="colo2"><u>THOR</u></h2>After Thor was exiled to Earth and landed in New Mexico, he tried to recover Mj√∏lnir after discovering it had made its way to Earth as well. Phil Coulson made note of Thor's strength, albeit human, and his combat skills, making his men "some of the most highly trained professionals in the world look like minimum wage mall cops." Then when the Destroyer came to Earth to kill Thor, Thor willingly handed himself over, an act that allowed him to regain his power and defeated the Destroyer. </div></div>
        <div class="col span-1-of-5"><div class="a"><h2 class="colo3"><u>CAPTAIN AMERICA</u></h2>Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers is a World War II veteran, and is known as the world's first superhero. Born within Brooklyn, New York City, the young Rogers had suffered from numerous health problems, and upon America's entry into World War II, was rejected from military service despite several attempts to enlist. Determined to serve, he ultimately volunteered for the top-secret Super Soldier program, and the frail Rogers was then enhanced to the peak of human perfection. Rogers soon joined the war effort as the mascot, given the new moniker of Captain America, and later joined the war with a combat role after he single-handedly liberated captured Allied POWs.</div></div>
        <div class="col span-1-of-5"><div class="a"><h2 class="colo4"><u>IRONMAN</u></h2>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark is a genius, billionaire, philanthropist and the former head of Stark Industries. Using his own great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors, returning home and becoming the armored superhero known as Iron Man, battling against terrorists as well as his former business partner Obadiah Stane. Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world, publicly announcing himself as Iron Man.</div></div>
    <div class="col span-1-of-5"><div class="ab"><h2 class="colo5"><u>BLACK WIDOW</u></h2>Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanoff, better known as Black Widow, is one of the most talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a founding member of the Avengers. Originally an agent of the Soviet agency for foreign intelligence, the KGB, she later became a member of S.H.I.E.L.D., the international counter-intelligence agency. Having extensive mastery in martial arts and armed with her Widow's Bite, Black Widow became one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most efficient agents. During one mission, she was sent undercover into Stark Industries to watch Tony Stark due to fears that he was dying. During this mission, Romanoff had assisted Stark with defeating Ivan Vanko's terrorist plots against him.</div></div>
